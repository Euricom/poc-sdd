8. [x] Error States - Design and implement error messages and empty states for scenarios like no agents available or failed operations `XS`

## Phase 2: Backend Integration

1. [ ] Database Schema Design - Design and implement SQLite database schema with agents table (id, name, description, content, created_at, updated_at) using Drizzle ORM `S`
2. [ ] API Routes for Agent CRUD - Create Next.js API routes for creating, reading, listing, and fetching individual agents with proper error handling `M`
3. [ ] Server-Side Data Fetching - Replace mock data with real database queries using Next.js server components and server actions `S`
4. [ ] Form Submission Handler - Connect upload form to API route to persist agent files to database with validation `S`
5. [ ] File Upload Validation - Implement server-side validation for agent file content (markdown format, size limits, required fields) `S`
6. [ ] Pagination System - Add pagination to agent gallery to handle growing number of agents with efficient database queries `M`
7. [ ] API Error Handling - Implement centralized error handling for API routes with appropriate HTTP status codes and user-friendly messages `S`

## Phase 3: User Management & Authentication

1. [ ] Clerk Authentication Integration - Integrate Clerk for user signup, login, logout, and session management across the application `M`
2. [ ] User Profile Pages - Create user profile pages showing contributed agents, join date, and basic profile information `M`
3. [ ] Protected Upload Route - Restrict agent file posting to authenticated users only with proper authorization checks `S`
4. [ ] Agent Ownership - Associate uploaded agents with user accounts and display author information on agent detail pages `S`
5. [ ] Edit & Delete Permissions - Allow users to edit or delete their own agents with ownership verification `M`
6. [ ] User Dashboard - Build a dashboard for users to manage their posted agents with edit, delete, and analytics capabilities `M`

## Phase 4: Advanced Features

1. [ ] Search Functionality - Implement full-text search across agent names, descriptions, and content with relevance scoring `M`
2. [ ] Categories & Tags System - Add tagging system for agents (code-review, testing, documentation, etc.) with filtering capabilities `M`
3. [ ] Agent Rating System - Enable users to rate agents with star ratings and display aggregate ratings on gallery cards `M`
4. [ ] Comments & Discussions - Allow users to comment on agent files with threaded discussions and markdown support `L`
5. [ ] Collections Feature - Let users create and share collections of related agents with custom names and descriptions `M`
6. [ ] Fork & Remix Functionality - Enable users to create copies of existing agents with attribution tracking `M`
7. [ ] Version History Tracking - Track changes to agent files over time with diff viewing and version rollback capabilities `L`
8. [ ] Advanced Analytics - Provide insights on agent usage, copy counts, views, and trending agents with charts and metrics `M`
9. [ ] AI-Powered Recommendations - Suggest relevant agents based on user viewing history and similar agent patterns `XL`
10. [ ] Email Notifications - Send notifications for comments, new followers, and popular agents using SendGrid integration `M`
11. [ ] Content Moderation Tools - Implement reporting, flagging, and admin review workflows for inappropriate content `L`

> Notes
> - Order items by technical dependencies and product architecture
> - Each item should represent an end-to-end (frontend + backend) functional and testable feature
> - Phase 1 establishes the complete UI/UX foundation with mock data
> - Phase 2 adds persistence and real data without requiring authentication
> - Phase 3 introduces user accounts and ownership
> - Phase 4 builds community and discovery features on top of the core platform
